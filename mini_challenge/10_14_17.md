# Mini Challenge Progress

### 10/14/2017

So today I began the [How to Make Pure CSS Images to Progress With Design-Focused Frontend Development](https://coding-artist.teachable.com/p/how-to-make-pure-css-images)

### Lesson 1

  - This course is taught by Michael Mangialardi whose teaching style I really enjoyed. His approach to covering these concepts was one that was really easy to understand and follow along with.

  - Pure CSS images are made with strictly HTML and CSS.

    - No image tags are used.

  - You are essentially creating vector graphics with CSS

  - I'm excited to go through this process and cover a lot of core CSS concepts that I may have previously overlooked.
    - Michael Mangialardi believes that learning how to make pure css images will teach you:
      - Basic design skills
      - About creativity and the being creative
      - How to break problems into smaller problems

  - In the second video of the course, he shares this blog post he wrote, [A Beginnerâ€™s Guide to Pure CSS Images](https://medium.com/coding-artist/a-beginners-guide-to-pure-css-images-ef9a5d069dd2)

    - I watched the video first, built the koala, and then read the blog post. It was a good and quick read and he reiterates the content of the video. I enjoyed covering the material again, and solidifying some of the concepts he talked about in the video. I think the article goes more in-depth and explains a lot of the CSS concepts in a manner that allowed me to garner more information as opposed to copying and pasting code. Both are great resources.

    - For him, he says that a pure CSS image will have:
      1) One HTML div per shape.
      2) A specific CSS class assigned to each div.
      3) Styles for those  CSS classes.
      4) An invisible box that will serve as the canvas.

    - We begin by breaking the image you want to make into specific shapes that you will build.

    - A concept that was covered that I need to remind myself of is to get perfect vertical centering take (100% - height%) / 2 and that should be your top percentage. For horizontal positioning take (100% - width%) / 2 and that will be your left percentage.

      - This is a simple concept that I often overlook.

#### CSS Koala

![CSS Koala](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ShugKnight24/pure_css_images/master/img/css_koala.png)

That is the koala I made. I added some nostrils, gave him a goatee, and switched some of the colors up. If you want to see my code, check it out [here](https://github.com/ShugKnight24/pure_css_images/tree/master/css_koala).

**Thoughts**: It was a lot of fun building this koala and following along with the tutorial. It was a nice outlet in between long sessions of coding a project for work.

I had a ton of fun going through the process, and I'm excited to go through the rest of the course and build some of the other recommended creatures.

Until next time,
