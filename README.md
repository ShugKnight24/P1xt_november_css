# P1xt's "Suck Less at CSS" November Challenge

So apparently, November isn't just a month for not shaving anymore. Now, I'm also expected to get better at CSS!?

@P1xt wrote a [blog](https://medium.com/p1xts-blog/lets-make-november-suck-less-at-css-month-7fa7c80b5387) about making November the month to get better at CSS. If I think I'm not a good developer, which I'm not, I would consider myself an even worse designer. Design does not come naturally to me. I know when something doesn't look good and if it is egregious enough, I will *most* likely change it. That is not good enough. To me, good enough is not even good enough. This is why I want to invest the time necessary to get better.

I believe in function over form and that is primarily why I have been, first and foremost, focusing my time on increasing my skills as a developer. I recognize that even if you have the coolest most baddest thing ever, but it looks like dumpster fire (no disrespect to dumpster fires), a lot of people probably still won't use it. There is a reason there is a subreddit dedicated to [crappy design](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrappyDesign/). Bad design sticks out. It feels unnatural. It can also ruin an experience if a user has to slog through your interface to accomplish the simplest of tasks.

  - **Side Note**: Crappy Design is such a great subreddit if you haven't ever checked it out. Subscribe! Like right now...

This is why I want to get better at design in general, but also begin to really get a solid handle on CSS. I will be using this GitHub Repo to track my progress going her recommendations to prepare for November and this [mini challenge](https://medium.com/p1xts-blog/mini-challenge-prep-for-suck-less-at-css-november-b04b30799ef6). Making pure CSS Images sounds awesome to me, and it would be fun to screw around and make some adorable images. I'm excited to get started in November, until then, I have a lot of prep to go through.

### Tentative To-Do

If I've learned anything from going through @P1xt's other guides, is that there is a ton of value in going through the basic resource recommendations thoroughly. I will make my best effort to get through all of the recommended material before the start of November. I will start with the basics and work my way up.

I will also start with the mini challenge in conjunction with the main prep to start building my skills with creating pure CSS images.

See you on the other side,
